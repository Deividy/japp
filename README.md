JavaScript Frontend Framework [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Deividy/japp.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Deividy/japp)
===============

_(Please don't. Don't get scared by the "framework" keyword.)_

JA is a really _simple_ JavaScript framework to control navigate flow and gives to you a good start for your application.

It depends of:

- [jQuery](https://jquery.com)
- [UnderscoreJS](http://underscorejs.org/)
- [BackboneJS](http://backbonejs.org/)
- [Functoids](https://github.com/Deividy/functoids) _(You probably don't know functoids, but once you use it, you'll love it.)_

## Why?

Do you feel like Backbone is _really_ just the back bone of your app?      
jQuery and underscore is nice but you have some pain when you start a single load app?       
Did you tried the AngularJS, but it's too much for what you need?       
Do you just need a simple navigate into "pages" and a simple right way to start your app?         

Well.. I'm in!

You can start your project _fast_.     
You can grow _easily_.      
You can use anything on backend, it's _just_ the frontend of your application.     
You can use any other frontend component, like _bootstrap_ or _knockout_.
